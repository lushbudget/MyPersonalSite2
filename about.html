     <h2>Dev Journey!</h2>
     <p>
      I just entered the world of code. My brother-in-law, Bobby, attended Fullstack Acadamy a few years ago and had a beautiful experience that also ended in a beautiful employment at Bloomberg. He testifies to the freedom and fun that dev work has brought into his life. Speaking to him about it and doing some online Python games stole my attention in a way that nothing has since I found music as a small child and running as an adult. I have a fantasy about getting to work on a team in a cool tech office! Sometimes people don't understand why I would feel that way since my current job is all tour busses and studios and different cities every night, but I crave some stability. I am also feeling quite tired of the relentless Los Angeles hustle. I also crave the kind of co-worker environment that isn't so marital (this is common for someone who has been in the same band for 20 years).
