     <h2>Dev Journey!</h2>
     <p>
      I just entered the world of code. My brother-in-law, Bobby, attended Fullstack Acadamy a few years ago and had a beautiful experience that also ended in a beautiful employment at Bloomberg. He testifies to the freedom and fun that dev work has brought into his life. Speaking to him about it and doing some online Python games stole my attention in a way that nothing has since I found music as a small child and running as an adult. I have a fantasy about getting to work on a team in a cool tech office! Sometimes people don't understand why I would feel that way since my current job is all tour busses and studios and different cities every night, but I crave some stability. I am also feeling quite tired of the relentless Los Angeles hustle. I also crave the kind of co-worker environment that isn't so marital (this is common for someone who has been in the same band for 20 years).

     <h2>Music!</h2>
     <p>
      I fell in love with music when I was a little boy and started piano and woodwinds. I was in bands all through school. Mostly jazz combos and larger ensembles. I always loved big band music. I was lucky that a bunch of the horn section from the old Johnny Carson Show retired to my little orchard town in central Washington State. They took me under their wings when I was in my early teens. Eventually, I got a full scholarship to studio Studio/Jazz Guitar at the University of Southern California. After a few years of study I decided to take it out on the road. I joined a band and toured the world many times over. I settled in Seattle, Washington where I found myself in the amazing PNW music scene in the early 2000's through the 2010's. I was in countless bands and made countless records. During that time I joined a British soul band called The Heavy. We have been making records and touring since. We have a full-time studio at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studio in Box, England. Lately I have been composing lots of ambient music using tape looping and analog synths. And always guitar. I love the guitar. I also write a ton of poetry and short stories.

     <h2>Run, Thomas! Run!</h2>
     <p>
      It's funny how you can go your entire life hating something and then fall head-over-heels in love with it one day out of the deepest blue. When the lock-downs set in, I was stranded without being able to train martial arts and yoga and all the other classes I had grown accustomed to. One day I thought, "I wonder if I could run a mile?". So I ran a mile. It hurt, but I spent the rest of the day feeling like I had accomplished soemthing great. Then I ran a mile the next morning. Again, I felt a sense of fulfillment. Like anything else that happened the rest of the day was just a bonus because I had already acheived something hard. Fast forward to today, I run 40-50 miles a week. I do a 15 mile run every Sunday. It is the way I see cities when I travel now. Of all the places I've been, it wasn't until I started running that I really got a feel for other places. Along with music, meditation, and my family (my wife and dog and kitten), it is what keeps my brain and body working the way it should.
